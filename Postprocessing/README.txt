1. Run these scripts from the Project/Simulation folders.
2. Fluka_Efluence_reader.m - Used this for USRTRACK tallies for energy fluence scoring to accelerate in-air and CTDI simulations. Scoring dose will take a long time. The output of this file should be used in the results excel sheet to compute dose/exposure.
3. MOSFET_DOSE_plot.m  - This script was used for MOSFET dose calculations in Phantom. 
4. All the other scripts in the folder were not used for the project, but used for testing.
5. Check the header of each script for a  detailed explanation
